# Executive Order 14160: Birthright Citizenship Challenge

**Status:** Currently before the U.S. Supreme Court (Spring 2026 Term)  
**Primary Case:** *Trump v. Barbara* (Cert granted Dec 5, 2025)

## 1. The Policy
Issued on January 20, 2025, EO 14160 seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment???s "subject to the jurisdiction thereof" clause.
- **Rule:** Automatic citizenship is denied to children born in the US unless at least one parent is a **U.S. Citizen** or **Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR)**.
- **Impact:** Children of undocumented immigrants or those on temporary visas (H-1B, F-1, B-1/B-2) are designated as "foreign nationals" at birth under this executive interpretation.

## 2. Legal Arguments
- **Administration Position:** "Jurisdiction" requires more than mere presence; it requires a permanent allegiance (domicile) that temporary or illegal residents do not possess.
- **Challengers' Position:** Points to *United States v. Wong Kim Ark* (1898), arguing the 14th Amendment applies to everyone born on US soil regardless of parental status.

## 3. Current 2026 Injunctions
- **Nationwide Hold:** The policy is currently **stayed** by a nationwide class-action preliminary injunction issued in *Barbara v. Trump* (D.N.H.) and upheld by the 9th Circuit. 
- **SCOTUS Timeline:** Oral arguments are scheduled for **April 2026**. A definitive ruling is expected by **June or July 2026**.
- **Agency Action:** While the "Implementation Plan" was released in July 2025, USCIS and the SSA are legally prohibited from withholding citizenship documents until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling.
