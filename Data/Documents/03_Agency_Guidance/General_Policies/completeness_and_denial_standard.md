# "Decision-Ready" Filing: Completeness and Denial Standards

## 1. The "No RFE" Policy
USCIS has reaffirmed the authority of officers to **deny applications without issuing a Request for Evidence (RFE)** or a Notice of Intent to Deny (NOID) if the initial filing is:
- Missing mandatory initial evidence.
- Filed on an outdated form edition.
- Inconsistent with the stated immigration pathway.

## 2. In-Person Interview Mandate
As of late 2025/early 2026, interview waivers for family-based cases (I-130/I-485) have been largely eliminated. 
- **Presumption:** An in-person interview is required unless specifically exempted by the District Director.
- **Credibility:** Officers are instructed to weigh inconsistencies in documentation heavily against the applicant's credibility during the live interview.

## 3. Form Edition Strictness
- **Form I-765:** Only the **08/21/25** edition will be accepted starting **March 5, 2026**.
- **Rule:** Use of any older version will result in an immediate rejection and return of fees.
