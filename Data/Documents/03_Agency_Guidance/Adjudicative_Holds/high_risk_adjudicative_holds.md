# Adjudicative Hold: High-Risk Country Benefit Requests

## 1. Overview
Effective January 1, 2026, USCIS has implemented a mandatory adjudicative hold on all pending benefit requests from nationals of "High-Risk Countries" as identified in Presidential Proclamation 10998.

## 2. Affected Applications
The hold applies to the following forms regardless of filing date:
- **I-129:** Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker
- **I-140:** Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers
- **I-485:** Adjustment of Status (Green Card)
- **I-589:** Application for Asylum and Withholding of Removal

## 3. Re-Vetting Mandate
Guidance directs officers to conduct a "Comprehensive Re-Review" of all benefits approved on or after **January 20, 2021**. This includes:
- Verification of identity standards under PP 10998.
- Mandatory re-interviews if derogatory information is identified.
- Coordination with FDNS (Fraud Detection and National Security) for TSDS/KST database checks.

## 4. Lifting the Hold
The hold remains in effect until a subsequent memorandum is issued by the USCIS Director. Any requests for litigation-related exemptions must be coordinated with the Office of Policy and Strategy.
