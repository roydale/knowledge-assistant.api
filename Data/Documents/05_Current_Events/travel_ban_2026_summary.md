- **Removal of Categorical Exceptions:** As of Jan 1, immediate family immigrant visas (IR-1/CR-1, IR-2, IR-5) are **no longer** exempt from the ban.
- **Vetting Surcharge:** Many nonimmigrant visas now require a supplemental $5,000???$15,000 "Visa Bond" if the applicant is from a high-overstay country (Effective Jan 21, 2026).
- **Consular Discretion:** Officers must reduce visa validity to the minimum possible (often single-entry, 3-month validity) for any approved waivers.

## 3. USCIS Adjudication Hold (Memo PM-602-0194)
Effective January 1, 2026, USCIS has expanded its "Hold and Review" process:
- **The Hold:** Final adjudication is paused for all pending benefits (I-129, I-140, I-485, I-765) for nationals of the 39 listed countries.
- **Re-Review Trigger:** All benefit requests approved on or after **January 20, 2021**, are subject to a mandatory comprehensive re-review, which may include a new in-person interview.
- **Exceptions:** Very limited, including I-90 (Green Card replacement) and certain athlete visas (P-visas) for major international events.

## 4. Immediate Immigrant Visa Pause (Jan 21, 2026)
*Warning:* Separate from the Travel Ban, the State Department has announced an indefinite pause on **all immigrant visa issuances** for **75 countries** starting January 21, 2026, pending a "Public Charge" and fraud-prevention review.
