# Tripe with Gravy

## Instructions
Boil some tripe in water and when it is boiled, cut it in strips, one
quarter of an inch wide and wipe it well with a cloth. Then put it in a
saucepan with butter, and when this is melted, add some brown stock or
good tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper, cook thoroughly and add
a pinch of grated cheese before taking from the saucepan.
