# Beef Tongue Boiled (Lingua di bue lessa)

## Instructions
The tongue is boiled like the beef. When half cooked remove the skin,
which is not nice to see and has no nutritious elements, although it is
served with a purée of peas, or spinach or potatoes or beans, etc.
But it can be served simply with sprigs of parsley.
