# Peas with Corned Beef (Piselli con la carne secca)

## Instructions
Put on the fire a hash of corned beef, garlic, parsley and oil, season
with a little salt and pepper and when the garlic is browned, put the
peas in. When they have absorbed the sauce, complete the cooking with
broth or, failing that, with water.
