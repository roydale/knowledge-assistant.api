# Pot Roast (Arrosto morto)

## Instructions
This can be done with all kinds of meats, but the best is milk veal.
Take a good piece of the loins, roll it and tie with a string and put on
the fire with good olive oil and butter, both in small quantity. Brown
well from all sides, salt when half cooked and complete the cooking with
a half cup of broth, seeing that little juice remains. If no broth is at
hand, use tomato sauce, or tomato paste diluted with water. Some corned
beef chopped fine can also be added.
