# Roman Fry (Fritto alla Romana)

## Instructions
### II.
This can be made when you happen to have some breast of roast chicken
left over. Some chicken breast, two or three slices of tongue and ham,
one tablespoonful of grated cheese, a taste of nutmeg, are the
ingredients used. Remove the skin of the chicken and cut it as well as
the tongue and the ham, into little cubes. Make a **Balsamella** (see No.
59\) in sufficient quantity and when it is cooked add the above
ingredients and let it cool well to fry using the wafer as in the
preceding.
