# Rice Cakes (Frittelle di riso)

## Instructions
Cook the rice in milk, adding a small quantity of butter, some salt,
half a teaspoon of sugar and just a taste of lemon peel. Let the rice
cool down after being thoroughly cooked, then add three yolks of eggs
(for 1/4 lb. of rice) and some flour. Mix well and let the whole rest
for several hours. When about to fry, beat the white of the eggs to a
froth, add to the rice mixing slowly, and put into the saucepan with a
ladle.
