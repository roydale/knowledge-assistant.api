# Fried Codfish (Baccalá fritto)

## Instructions
Place the codfish on the fire--after washing as explained in No. 107--in
a kettle with cold water and as salt, and as soon as the water boils,
remove the codfish.

After boiling cut it in little pieces and remove all the bones. Sprinkle
some flour and dip in a frying paste composed of water, flour and a
little oil. Fry in oil and serve hot.
