# Pigeon Surprise (Piccione a sorpresa)

## Instructions
The pigeon (or chicken) must be opened and stuffed with a cutlet of milk
veal. Of course this cutlet must be of proportionate size. Beat it well
to render it thinner and more tender, season with salt, pepper, a pinch
of spices and little pieces of butter, roll it and put inside the pigeon
sewing the opening. The liver and giblets of the pigeon can be cooked
apart in brown stock or in butter, after being chopped. With the
resulting gravy the cutlet can be smeared. In this way the different
flavor of the two qualities of meat is better amalgamated.
