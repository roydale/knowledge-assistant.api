# White Sauce (Salsa bianca)

## Instructions
This sauce can be served with boiled asparagus or with cauliflower. The
ingredients are 1/4 lb. of butter, a tablespoonful of flour, a
tablespoonful vinegar, one yolk of egg, salt and pepper, broth or water
in sufficient quantity.

Put first on the fire the flour with half the butter and when it begins
to be browned pour over it the broth or the water little by little,
stirring with the wooden spoon and adding the rest of the butter and the
vinegar without making the water boil too much. When taken off the fire
add the yolk of the egg, stir and serve.
