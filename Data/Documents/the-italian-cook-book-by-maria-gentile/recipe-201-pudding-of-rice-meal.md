# Rice Meal Pudding (Budino di farina di riso)

## Ingredients
 - Milk, one quart.
 - Rice meal, seven ounces.
 - Sugar, four and a half ounces.
 - Six eggs.
 - A pinch of salt.
 - Taste of vanilla.

## Instructions
First dissolve the rice meal in half a pint of the milk when cold, and
pour it in the rest of the milk when it is boiling. This is done to
prevent the formation of lumps. When the meal is cooked add the sugar,
the butter and the salt. Remove from the fire and when it is lukewarm
mix the eggs (beaten) and the taste of vanilla. Then bake the pudding
like all the others and serve warm.
