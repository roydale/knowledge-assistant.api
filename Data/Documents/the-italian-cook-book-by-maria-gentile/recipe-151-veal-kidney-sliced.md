# Veal Kidney Sliced (Rognone di vitello affettato)

## Instructions
Cut in thin slices one or two veal kidneys, removing the granulous part
that is to be found in the middle, and put the slices in a saucepan with
a piece of butter, a bunch of parsley chopped very fine together with a
clove of garlic. Add a cup of hot broth; salt moderately and let it cook
without boiling, until the sauce is reduced to about one third.

## Notes
One tablespoonful of vinegar adds a pleasant taste to this dish.
