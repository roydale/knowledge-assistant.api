# H-1B Specialty Occupation Visa (2026 Status)

## 1. Key Stats & Authorities
- **Primary Law:** INA 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b)
- **FY 2027 Registration Fee:** $215 (Increased from $10)
- **Presidential Proclamation Fee:** **$100,000** "Specialty Occupation Fee"
    - *Note:* Required for new petitions filed on/after Sept 21, 2025, for beneficiaries outside the U.S. or those requesting consular notification.

## 2. 2026 Weighted Selection System
As of February 27, 2026, the random lottery has been replaced by a **weighted, wage-level based system**. The higher the wage level offered, the more "entries" a beneficiary receives in the selection pool.

| Wage Level | Description | Lottery Entries |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Level IV** | Fully Competent / Highly Specialized | 4 Entries |
| **Level III** | Experienced / Special Skills | 3 Entries |
| **Level II** | Qualified / Mid-Level | 2 Entries |
| **Level I** | Entry-Level / Routine | 1 Entry |

## 3. Policy Shifts (2025???2026)
1. **Wage Prioritization:** The new "Weighted Selection" rule effectively prioritizes Level 4 and Level 3 wages, significantly reducing the odds for Level 1 (entry-level) applicants.
2. **The $100k Surcharge:** Under Proclamation 10949, employers must pay the $100,000 fee via Pay.gov at the time of petition filing unless a "National Interest Waiver" is granted by the Secretary of DHS.
3. **IT Outsourcing Scrutiny:** Increased vetting for third-party worksites (EO 14161) requires extensive proof of the "employer-employee relationship" and "contractual specialty work" for the entire duration of the requested stay.

## 4. Required Documentation
- [ ] **LCA (Labor Condition Application):** Must certify the prevailing wage and specific DOL Wage Level.
- [ ] **Evidence of Specialty Occupation:** Tightened criteria require a degree *directly* related to the specific duties.
- [ ] **Proof of $100k Payment:** Pay.gov receipt must be attached to the I-129 petition if the beneficiary is subject to the Proclamation.
- [ ] **Vetting Questionnaire:** New 2025 supplemental forms regarding foreign political/military affiliations.

## 5. 2026 Filing Fees (Consolidated)
- **I-129 Base Fee:** $780
- **Asylum Program Fee:** $600
- **Fraud Fee:** $500
- **ACWIA Fee:** $750 or $1,500
