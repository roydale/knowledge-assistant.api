- **Qualifying Relationship:** The US company must be a parent, branch, subsidiary, or affiliate of the foreign company.
- **One-Year Rule:** The employee must have worked abroad for the foreign entity for at least one continuous year within the last three years.

## 2. 2026 Compliance Alerts
- **New Office Petitions:** Only granted for 1 year initially. Must show "substantial progress" (physical space + hiring) for any extension.
- **Wage Scrutiny:** While there is no "Prevailing Wage" for L-1, 2026 policy memos suggest that L-1 salaries must be "commensurate with management duties" to avoid RFE (Request for Evidence).
- **Blanket L Changes:** Large companies must ensure the **Form I-129S** is filed alongside the I-129 for all extensions of stay.
