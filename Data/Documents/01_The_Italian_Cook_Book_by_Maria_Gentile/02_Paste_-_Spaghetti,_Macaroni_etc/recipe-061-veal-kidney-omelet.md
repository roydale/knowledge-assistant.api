# Veal Kidney Omelet (Frittata di rognone di vitella)

## Instructions
Take a veal kidney, open it lengthwise and leave all its fat. Season
with oil, salt and pepper, broil it and cut in thin slices. Beat enough
eggs in proportion to the size of the kidney, season them with salt and
pepper, both in moderate quantity and mix with them a sprig of parsley
and some grated cheese. Put the sliced kidney in the eggs, mix all
together and make an omelet with some butter.
