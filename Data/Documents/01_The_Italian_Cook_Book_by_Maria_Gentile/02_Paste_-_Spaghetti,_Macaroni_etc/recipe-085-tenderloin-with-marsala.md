# Tenderloin with Marsala (Filetto al marsala)

## Instructions
Roll a piece of the tenderloin, tie it and, if it is about two pounds,
put it on the fire with a middle-sized onion cut in thin slices, some
thin slices of ham and a piece of butter, seasoning but moderately with
salt and pepper. When it is browned from all sides and the onion is
consumed, sprinkle a pinch of flour, let this take color and then pour
some soup stock or water. Make it simmer on a low fire, then rub the
gravy through a sieve, skim off the fat and with this and half a small
tumbler of Marsala or Sherry wine put it back on the fire to simmer
again. Serve with the gravy neither too liquid nor too thick.

## Notes
The filet can also be larded with bacon and cooked in butter and Marsala
only.
