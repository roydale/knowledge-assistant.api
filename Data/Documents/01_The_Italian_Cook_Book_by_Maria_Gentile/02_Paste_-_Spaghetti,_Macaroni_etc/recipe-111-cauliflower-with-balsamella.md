# Cauliflower with Balsamella (Cavolfiore colla balsamella)

## Instructions
Remove from a good sized cauliflower the external leaves and the green
ribs, make a deep cut crosswise in the stalk and cook it in salted
water. Then cut it in sections and brown with butter, salt and pepper.
Put it in a baking tin, throw over a small pinch of grated cheese, cover
with the **balsamella** (No. 54) and brown the surface.

## Notes
Serve this cauliflower as an **entremets** or as a side-dish with boiled
chicken or a stew.
