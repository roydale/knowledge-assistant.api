# Risotto with Chicken Giblets (Risotto alla Milanese II)

## Instructions
The broth for this risotto may be made by cooking together the giblets,
neck and tips of wings of a chicken which is to be roasted, or it may be
made from the left-overs of roast fowl.

Boil the rice until it is about half done in salted water. Then let the
water cook away and begin adding the broth, in such quantity that the
rice will be nearly dry when it is tender. Fry one chopped onion in the
oil or fat. Some mushrooms cut up small are a very good addition to this
"**Soffritto**". Mince the chicken giblets and add to the onion. Stir the
mixture into the rice. Add grated cheese and a beaten egg just as the
rice is taken from the fire.
