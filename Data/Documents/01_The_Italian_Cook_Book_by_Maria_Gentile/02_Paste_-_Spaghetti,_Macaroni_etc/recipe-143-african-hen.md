# African Hen (Gallina di Faraone)

## Instructions
This fowl, that resembles the partridge, should not be too fresh, like
all game.

The best way to cook the African hen is roasted at the spit. Put in the
inside a ball of butter dipped in salt and wrap it in a piece of paper
greased with butter and sprinkled with salt. This paper must be removed
when the fowl is nearly cooked, and then the cooking is completed
greasing with more butter and adding more salt.
