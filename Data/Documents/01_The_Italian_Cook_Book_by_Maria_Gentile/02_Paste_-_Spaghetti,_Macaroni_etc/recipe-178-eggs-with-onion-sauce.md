# Eggs with Onion Sauce (Uova trippate)

## Instructions
Prepare some hard boiled eggs, shell and cut into disks one third of an
inch thick.

Melt in a saucepan a piece of butter in which brown half an onion cut
into thin slices, to be removed from the butter when browned. Then add
to the butter two teaspoonfuls of flour, mix but don't allow to brown,
thin with a cup of hot broth, add salt and pepper and let simmer for ten
minutes. Put the sliced eggs in the sauce to warm them, stir a little,
but carefully to avoid breaking them, and do not boil again. Just before
serving add to the sauce a teaspoonful of cream and stir carefully.
