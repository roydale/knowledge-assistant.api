# Rice with Saffron (Riso alla Milanese con Zafferano)

## Instructions
Wash and dry the rice and put it in boiling broth (beef or chicken
broth). When the rice is half cooked add half its weight of marrow of
beef bone, cut into small pieces. A few minutes are sufficient for the
cooking of the marrow. Add grated cheese and remove the kettle from the
fire.

Dissolve some saffron in one or two tablespoonfuls of broth; sift it
through a sieve and mix with rice, which is to be served very hot, and
makes an excellent soup.
