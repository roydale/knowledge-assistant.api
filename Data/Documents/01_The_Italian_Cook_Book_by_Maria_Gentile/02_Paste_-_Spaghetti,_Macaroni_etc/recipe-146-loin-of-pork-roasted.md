# Loin of Pork Roasted (Lombo di maiale arrosto)

## Instructions
The loin of pork, cut in little pieces forms an excellent roast at the
spit. The pieces of pork are to be divided by little pieces of toast and
greased with oil.

If the pork is to be baked, choose that piece of the loin that has its
ribs and that may weigh six or eight pounds. Lard it with garlic,
rosemary or bay leaf and a few cloves, but moderately, and season with
salt and pepper.

## Notes
This roast is very popular in Italy, where they call it **arista**.
