# Green Sauce (Salsa verde)

## Instructions
Chop all together some capers that have been in vinegar, one anchovy, a
small slice of onion and just a taste of garlic. Crush the resulting
hash with the blade of a knife to make it very fine. Add a sprig of
parsley, chopped together with some leaves of basil and dissolve the
whole in very good olive oil and lemon juice.

## Notes
This sauce is excellent to season boiled chicken or cold boiled fish or
hard boiled eggs.

Green Peppers can take the place of capers, if these are not at hand.
