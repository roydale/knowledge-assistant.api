# Fried Dog-Fish (Palombo fritto)

## Instructions
Cut the dog-fish in slices, not very thick, and place it in a plate with
beaten eggs somewhat salted. Leave for some hours until half an hour
before frying, dip the slices in a mixture of bread crumbs, grated
cheese, garlic and parsley chopped fine, salt and pepper. A clove of
garlic is sufficient for one pound of fish. Fry in oil and serve with
lemon.
