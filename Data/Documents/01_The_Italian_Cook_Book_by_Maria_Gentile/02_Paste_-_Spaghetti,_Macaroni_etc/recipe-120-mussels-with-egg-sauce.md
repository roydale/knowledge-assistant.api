# Mussels with Egg Sauce (Arselle in salsa d'uovo)

## Instructions
A good washing with fresh water is sufficient for mussels that do not
have any sand to be cleaned away. Put them on the fire with a sauce of
oil, garlic, parsley and a pinch of pepper. Shake them and keep the
saucepan covered seeing that they do not absorb all of the sauce. Take
them out when they are open and prepare the following sauce: one or more
yolks of egg, according to the quantity, lemon juice, one teaspoonful of
flour, broth and some of their own juice. Cook this sauce until it
becomes a smooth cream and pour it on the mussels when they are served.
