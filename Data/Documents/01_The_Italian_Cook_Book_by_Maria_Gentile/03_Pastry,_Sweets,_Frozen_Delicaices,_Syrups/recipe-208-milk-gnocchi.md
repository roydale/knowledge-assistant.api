# Milk Gnocchi (Gnocchi di latte)

## Ingredients
 - One quart of milk.
 - Sugar, nine ounces.
 - Starch in powder, four ounces.
 - Eight yolks of eggs.
 - A taste of vanilla.

## Instructions
Mix everything together as you would do for a cream and put on the fire
in a saucepan, continually stirring with a ladle. When the mixture has
become hard keep it a few moments more on the fire and then pour it in a
plate to make it about half an inch thick and cut it into diamonds when
it is cold. Put these diamonds one over the other with symmetry in a
baking tin or in a fireproof glass plate, with some little pieces of
butter in between and brown them a little in the oven. Serve hot.
