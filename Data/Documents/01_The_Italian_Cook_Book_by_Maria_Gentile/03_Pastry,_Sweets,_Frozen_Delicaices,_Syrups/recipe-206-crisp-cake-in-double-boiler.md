# Crisp Cake in Double Boiler (Croccante a bagno maria)

## Ingredients
 - Sugar, five and a half ounces.
 - Sweet almonds, three ounces.
 - Egg-yolks, five.
 - Milk, one pint.

## Instructions
Skin the almonds and chop them in little pieces about as big as a grain
of wheat. Put on the fire two thirds of the sugar and when it is all
melted pour the almonds and stir continually with the ladle until they
have taken the color of cinnamon. Then put them in a tin greased with
butter and when they are cold, pound them very fine with the remaining
third of sugar.

Add the yolks and then the milk, mix well and pour the mixture in a mold
with a hole in the middle and greased evenly with butter. Place the mold
in a double boiler so that it will be cooked by steam.
