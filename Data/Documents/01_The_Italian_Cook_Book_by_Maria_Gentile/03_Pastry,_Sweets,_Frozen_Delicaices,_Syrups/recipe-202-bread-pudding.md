## Instructions
Cut the bread crumb into pieces and soak in cold milk. Then rub though a
sieve. Melt the butter in a double boiler (in a vessel immersed in
boiling water) and mix with the eggs until butter and eggs are
incorporated to each other. Add the bread crumb and the sugar and mix
well. Pour the mixture in a mold greased with butter and sprinkled with
bread crumb ground fine and bake like other puddings.
