# Tutti Frutti

## Instructions
To make this ice a special ice cream mold is necessary, or a tin
receptacle that can be closed hermetically.

Take several varieties of fruits of the season, ripe and of good
quality, that is to say, strawberries, cherries, plums, apricots, a big
peach, a good sized pear, a piece of good cantaloupe. Peel, skin and
remove stones and cores of all these fruits. Then cut them into very
thin slices, throwing away the cores and stones.

When the fruit is prepared in this manner, weigh it, and sprinkle over
one fifth of its weight of powdered sugar, squeezing also one lemon.
Mix everything and let the mixture rest for half an hour.

Put a sheet of paper in the bottom of the mold that is to be filled with
the fruit pressed together, close, and pack in salt and ice, keeping it
for two hours or a little less.

## Notes
This is not the **tutti frutti** ice cream as is known in America, but a
**macédoine** of fruits, that comes very pleasant to the taste in the
summer months.
