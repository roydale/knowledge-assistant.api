# Lentil Soup (Zuppa di lenticchie)

## Instructions
The lentil soup is prepared in the same way as the bean soup, only
substituting lentils for beans. A good combination is that of lentils
and rice. The nutritive qualities of the lentils are not sufficiently
known in this country, but all books on dietetics speak very highly of
them.
